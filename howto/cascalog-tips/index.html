        We use a big data processing library
        called <a href="http://cascalog.org/">Cascalog</a> to process
        the large variety and occasionally volumes of data for things
        like the <a href="http://openhealthdata.cdehub.org/">CDEC
        Open Health Data Platform</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are already great tutorials to get you up and running
        like <a href="https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient-Cascalog">Cascalog
        for the Impatient</a> and other tutorials and guides at
        the <a href="http://cascalog.org/articles/guides.html">cascalog.org
        guide page</a> so what we'll do here is share some tips and
        tricks that will help you be more effective in using Cascalog
        and doing general data processing once you've learned the
        basics. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason we chose Cascalog as a technology to process our
        data is that it allows us to deal with small data locally on a
        single machine in a very fast feedback way at
        the <a href="http://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome">REPL</a>
        yet it also allows us to scale up to dealing with petabytes of
        data in a <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>
        Cluster. This combination of flexibility, interactivity and
        power make Cascalog difficult to beat or even match.
      </p>

      <p>
        Read below for our tips and tricks on how you can be more
        productive and effective with Cascalog and use it to scrub,
        query and analyse all sizes of data.

            <h4>Tip One - A basic query per data source</h4>
            
            <p class="lead">
              The first thing you should do when bringing in a new
              data file is create a query that gives you a clean, cut
              down version of that file with the columns you find
              interesting. 
            </p>

              If the example opposite is difficult to read, you can
              see the original

            <!-- Step left column content. -->
            <h4>Tip Two - Don't filter the bad, keep the good</h4>
            
            <p class="lead">
              The universe of bad data is infinite. Trying to come up
              with rules to filter out every type of bad data will
              leave you frustrated with broken code and fast
              approaching deadlines.
            </p>

            <p>
              The universe of good data is much smaller though. You
              probably already know what your data rows look like in
              the file you are processing. Find them and keep them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Instead of writing a function to remove the bad rows,
              write one that will keep the rows you know to be
              good. This let's you ignore the big universe of bad
              rows. I usually call these functions <code>data-line?</code>.

            <h4>Step Three - Isolate I/O</h4>
            
            <p class="lead">
               Notice how the function takes an "in" parameter, this
              time called gp-outcoomes, rather than opening up the
              file as a part of the basic query. This is so you can
              test with dummy data rather than being tied to always
              needing a file.
            </p>

            <p>
              Data sources can be local files, files on hdfs, s3 or
              swift. They can also be functions or data structures in
              memory. This gives us a lot of flexibility and means
              that we can test things with a simple vector of vectors
              or connect to local files when running locally or to big
              data systems like Cassandra when running in a cluster.

          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <!-- Step left column content. -->
            <h4>Tip Four - Pass functions around</h4>
            
            <p class="lead">
              Following to principles of simplicity as laid out above,
              you should also consider passing functions into other
              functions rather than calling them inside.
            </p>

            <p>
              Again, this will help with testing and being able to
              move from local files to other data sources. Being able
              to compose functions like this gives you a tremendous
              amount of power and flexibility.

            <p class="lead">
              The more data you move around, the longer your queries
              will take to complete.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus, you should always look for ways to cut down the
              number of fields you are interested in and the number of
              rows that concern you. This really saves times when
              doing joins, which are expensive in hadoop and other big
              data systems that don't have indexes to speed things up.

            Looking for prescribing variation outliers can identify important
            behaviours or changes in individual doctors or in areas of the
            country. This tutorial walks through how to visualise this variation,
            and how to make sure what you do is statistically sensible.

            <h4>Step Four - Visualising Data</h4>

            <h4>Simple Visualisation</h4>
            <p>
              Initially, it's probably useful to just visualise
              variation in diabetes prevalence by CCG area.
            </p>


            <h4>Getting cleverer</h4>
            <p>
              We might also want to add the ability to 'drill down'
              into an area and see areas of high prevalence, so that
              users can see where the biggest problems are to address.
            </p>

            <h4>Thinking about spending</h4>

            <p>
              We now want to start to bring in the prescribing data. We
              can start out keeping it really simple, and looking at
              total spend per area.
            </p>

            <p>
              But we know that some areas have more people than others;
              and also, some populations have a higher incidence of
              diabetes than others. So we really need to look at
              spending or prescribing _per diabetic_ to make sure we're
              showing something useful.
            </p>

            <h4>Visualise spending per head</h4>

            <p></p>

            <h4>Visualise changes over time</h4>

            <p>
              We know that the thing that's really interesting to our
              end user is changes over time. So we'll add charts of
              spending per head over time that they can use to look at
              changes.
            </p>

            <p>
              We could go further and add statistical significance
              measures around what changes are statistically
              meaningful, but that may get misleading as there are so
              many variables here (what drugs we've chosen, what
              influences selection of those drugs, how accurate the
              prevalence measures are, and lots of other things) so in
              this case it makes sense to leave the user to look at
              the charts and see whether they appear to have made an
              impact.
            </p>

              Now we've put together all the pieces, let's set it all
              up in a website that allows them to:

              <ul>
                <li>start on a page that shows diabetes prevalence per
                area</li>
                <li>search for the postcode where they did a roadshow</li>
                <li>see a timeseries of the last 2 years' spending per head, with a line
                  for each of the 10 nearest GP surgeries</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            
            <p>

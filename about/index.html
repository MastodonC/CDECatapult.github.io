      The <strong>CDEC Open Health Data Platform</strong>
      has been developed by the
      <a href="{{ page.cdec_url }}">Connected Digital EconomyCatapult (CDEC)</a>
      and <a href="{{ page.mastodon_c_url }}">Mastodon C</a>
      to stimulate data science innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is intended to demonstrate and enable SME innovators in
      the fields of data analysis, data visualization, service
      design, web and app development the potential to innovate
      with new sources and types of linked health data. It is also
      intended to demonstrate to public and private sector data
      owners the economic and service enhancements possible through
      opening and integrating data by using common standards.

      Over the next eight weeks you can expect to see new health
      related data sets, maps, integration tools and functionality
      added to the site. We will decide what to incorporate based
      largely on your feedback to this alpha launch, so please do
      get in touch.
    </p>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>

    <p>
      This site takes data from sources like the
      <a href="{{ page.hscic_url }}">Health and
      Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC)</a>
      and shows how it can be turned into visualisations and analysis
      to answer specific questions for your organisation.
      This is the ALPHA version of the site, which shows how
      to take a small number of datasets including data about
      GP prescriptions and diabetes prevalence to show the extent
      of diabetes treatment in the UK.
